                Managing money can be overwhelming at times when we are a little uninformed on the best ways to save,
                budget, and even invest. For this reason, we have researched frequently asked questions about money that
                can
                bring you some clarity.

                        you are making.</p>
                    <p> Yes, you do need one to keep track of your income. A simple budgeting rule is the
                        <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">50-20-30 rule: </strong></p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">50% </strong> of your income covers your living essentials:
                        rent, groceries, transportation for work, healthcare, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">20% </strong> of your income goes to your financial goals: <br>

                <div class="question-text money">
                    <p>Before we go into more detail, remember that budgeting should have some flexibility, and do not
                        give yourself a hard time if you fall off track. In the end, the important thing is to keep
                        going.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">Step 1: </strong>Look at your payslips and give each dollar a job
                        into the <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">50-20-30 </strong> categories. By organising your money
                        into categories, you will know how much money you will be saving at the end of the month. </p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">Step 2: </strong> Let's take a look at your spending habits when
                        you are not on a budget. What did you buy in your everyday life over a month? Write everything
                        down as detailed as possible. </p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">Step 3: </strong> After putting your money into set categories
                        (living essentials, financial goals, wants), it is also good to see what you can cut off.
                        Perhaps you have a subscription (Hulu, Netflix) that you are no longer using?</p></p>

                    <p>Investing is the act of putting your money into a commodity, real estate, or companies to
                        generate income.

                        One of the easiest investments to begin with is a retirement savings account. You do not need to
                        add lots of money to your retirement savings account, and it will slowly start to accumulate and
                        gain interest. </p>

                    <p>According to Career Contessa, when it comes to debt it depends wether it is student loans or
                        credit card debt.
                        When it comes to your credit card, it is best to keep your usage to 30 percent or less of the
                        limit. For your debt in general (including car loans, house loans, personal loans), the target
                        number is 20 percent or less.</p>
                    <p>Still not sure? Ask yourself these questions to gauge: Can you only make the minimum on your
                        payments? Are you skipping certain bills to pay off others? Are your cards maxed out? Are you
                        living paycheck to paycheck?</p>
                    <p> If you’re maxed out on one or several cards, come up with a dedicated plan to pay them down
                        immediately. Focus on paying off the card with the highest interest first, then pick the
                        remaining ones off one at a time. Use this credit payment calculator to help guide you:

                        do we split our finances?</p>

                <div class="question-text money">
                    <p>According to Your Money Under 30, here are the Do’s and Don'ts when you are with a partner and
                        have not been married yet.</p>
                    <p>Marriage does provides certain legal and financial safeguards for both couples. However, many
                        couples are managing a joint budget without being married. So here are some things to watch out
                        for.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">DON’T share assets: </strong> Do not buy anything together. That
                        goes for houses, cars, and furniture, and especially checking accounts. Yes, you love him or
                        her. But if things go sour, each takes their own.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">DON’T share debts: </strong> As tempting as it often is, I would
                        recommend that you don’t cosign a loan for your partner. Whether you stay together or not, if he
                        or she defaults, you either pay up or lose your credit. Cosigners should be family members. End
                        of story.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;">DO share expenses: </strong> Avoid the “free-for-all” approach to
                        budgeting that I mentioned above. Before you move in, decide whether you will share expenses
                        fifty-fifty or proportionately based upon salary. You may consider opening a joint checking
                        account just for paying expenses. This should only be for bills and groceries.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: #5abfb4;"> DO plan for the worst: </strong> Although unlikely, consider the
                        possibility that one of you could die. You’ll need to choose beneficiaries for everything from
                        insurance policies to retirement plans.</p>

# HerFinance

A project implemented for the 2 day FCA TechSprint. Our team came up with the idea to create a platform for women to help provide them with important financial information, in our case, specifically related to Investment. I used Spotify API and web scraping to gather information from relative websites. This of course could be extended by implementing a full on log in system so that information could be personalised for each user based on their needs, and other features such as a budgeting dashboard could be built on top of it. 

The front-end of the website was implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JS.
The back-end was implemented using Python Flask.
